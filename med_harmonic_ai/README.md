# Medicinal Harmonic Resonance AI

An AI-driven drug discovery platform that integrates traditional medical systems (Ayurveda, Unani, Allopathy, and Homeopathy) with modern computational methods to identify effective compound combinations.

## Project Overview

This platform uses artificial intelligence to:
1. Analyze compounds from diverse medical traditions
2. Predict efficacy, safety, and interactions
3. Generate optimal combinations for disease treatment
4. Validate predictions through simulation

## Current Focus

The current proof-of-concept focuses on Type 2 Diabetes treatments, integrating knowledge from four medical systems to discover synergistic compound combinations.
