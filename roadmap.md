## Unique Value Proposition

This AI-driven approach would differ from conventional drug discovery platforms by:

1. Explicitly modeling cross-system synergies from diverse medical traditions
2. Using the "harmonic resonance" metaphor as a guide for identifying multi-target, rhythmic interactions
3. Preserving traditional knowledge while enhancing it with cutting-edge AI
4. Focusing on combination therapies rather than single-target compounds

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Data assessment**: Evaluate available traditional medicine compound databases
2. **Pilot model**: Build a simplified AI predictor for a specific diabetes sub-target
3. **Proof-of-concept validation**: Validate predictions for 5-10 known compounds
4. **Technical specification**: Detailed architecture document for full implementation
5. **Partner identification**: Research labs, traditional medicine experts, and computational resources
